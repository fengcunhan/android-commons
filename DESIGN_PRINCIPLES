Design Principles
-----------------

Many all-around Android libraries require invasive changes to the hosting
application to work, i.e.: they often require that you inherit from a
customized Application class.

For example: both Droid-Fu and GreenDroid have their custom class which inherits
from android.app.Application which is required for them to work properly. This
design decision will needlessly cause these two libraries to step on each other
toes when used inside the same project.

We take a different approach: our library consists of loosely coupled components
and helpers (such as our optional subclass of android.app.Application) which
provide shortcuts to access additional features at developers discretion.
